If you have Adobe XD then I encourage you to download my XD file and open it with XD.

Click the play button in the upper right-hand corner of Adobe to run through my mock-up. <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=bi2u1k" target="_blank"><img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/bi2u1k.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>
